# Derived Messages

While the data standard is mainly concerned with telemetry messages, cases exist where back-end processing needs to 'log' information about a device that can be passed into the message processing pipeline. At this stage we are not clear on when to draw the line betwen system logging and deriving messages. In the current spec of derived messages, the intent is for derived messages to become 'first class' data about the device, rather than an application log.
